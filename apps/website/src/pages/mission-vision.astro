          <h2>A Legacy of Horses</h2>
          <p class="content-section__text">Meadowlark Ranch is dedicated to thoughtfully preserving rare and heritage horse breeds, championing their ongoing legacy through education, stewardship, and immersive guest experiences.</p>
          <p class="content-section__text">Our commitment to the Percheron breed — once numbering in the hundreds of thousands across America, reduced to just 85 registered animals by 1954 — drives everything we do. Through the CCP Percherons program, we are actively working to ensure these magnificent animals thrive for generations to come.</p>
