          <h2>Pastures &amp; Turnout</h2>
          <p class="content-section__text">Our horses enjoy access to well-maintained pastures with safe, sturdy fencing, fresh water sources, and shelter from the elements. We practice rotational grazing to maintain pasture health, and our turnout schedule ensures every horse receives ample time to move, socialize, and simply be a horse.</p>
          <p class="content-section__text">The property features scenic pathways and observation areas where visitors can watch the horses at rest and in motion — a peaceful experience that reminds us why we do what we do.</p>
