      <h2>A Timeless Tradition</h2>
      <p class="content-section__text">There is something profoundly magical about the rhythmic clip-clop of hooves, the gentle sway of a carriage, and the Colorado sky stretching endlessly overhead. Meadowlark Ranch's carriage services bring this timeless tradition to life with our magnificent Percheron horses and beautifully maintained carriages.</p>

          <h2>Our Percheron Horses</h2>
          <p class="content-section__text">Our carriage fleet is powered by the finest Percheron horses in the region — gentle giants standing over 17 hands tall and weighing upwards of 2,000 pounds. Despite their impressive stature, Percherons are known for their calm temperament, intelligence, and willingness to work, making them the ideal carriage horse.</p>
          <p class="content-section__text">Each of our Percherons is meticulously trained and cared for under the expert guidance of our head trainer, Wilbur Helmuth, whose deep roots in the Amish farming tradition bring generational expertise to our program.</p>
