      <h2>Where Teams Come Together</h2>
      <p class="content-section__text">At Meadowlark Ranch, team building is more than ropes courses and trust falls. Our equine-assisted programs leverage the intuitive nature of horses to unlock communication, build empathy, and strengthen the bonds that make teams extraordinary.</p>

          <h2>Equine-Assisted Team Activities</h2>
          <p class="content-section__text">Horses are remarkably attuned to human emotion and body language, making them powerful partners in team development. Our guided equine activities are designed by certified professionals to address specific team dynamics, including trust, communication, leadership, and problem-solving.</p>
          <p class="content-section__text">No horse experience is required — our programs are accessible to everyone, from first-time visitors to experienced equestrians.</p>

      <h2>Why Horses?</h2>
      <p class="content-section__text">Horses are honest mirrors — they respond to authenticity, not authority. Working with horses in a team setting reveals patterns, uncovers strengths, and creates breakthrough moments that traditional team building exercises simply cannot replicate. The result is a more connected, communicative, and resilient team.</p>
