## Beyond the Boardroom

The most productive corporate gatherings share a common trait: they take people out of their routine environment and place them somewhere that stimulates new thinking. A hotel conference room with fluorescent lighting and stale coffee does not do this. **Meadowlark Ranch does.**

Set against the Flatiron Mountains in Longmont, Colorado, our ranch offers corporate clients a venue that is equal parts inspiring and functional — a place where strategic planning sessions benefit from mountain air, where client appreciation events unfold beside magnificent Percheron horses, and where teams discover capabilities they never knew they had.

## Corporate Event Types

## The Meadowlark Difference

What makes a corporate event at Meadowlark Ranch fundamentally different from a hotel or conference center?

**The setting resets the mind.** When your team steps out of a meeting room and sees the Flatirons on the horizon and Percherons grazing in the pasture, something shifts. Creativity opens. Defenses lower. Conversations deepen.

**The experience bonds.** Shared experiences in unique settings create connections that survive the return to the office. A team that has spent an afternoon learning to communicate through interaction with a 2,000-pound horse does not go back to business as usual.

**The impression lasts.** Your clients, partners, and team members will remember this event. Not because it was lavish — though it will be — but because it was genuine, distinctive, and unlike anything else on their calendar.

## Logistics & Planning

Our corporate events team manages every detail:

- **Site visits and walk-throughs** for planning teams
- **Custom proposals** tailored to your budget and objectives
- **Vendor coordination** for any services beyond our standard offerings
- **Transportation coordination** including shuttle service from Denver and Boulder
- **On-site event management** from setup through breakdown
- **Post-event follow-up** to ensure complete satisfaction
