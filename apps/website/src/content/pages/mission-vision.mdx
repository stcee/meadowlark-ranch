## Our Mission

At Meadowlark Ranch, we are guided by a singular conviction: that the bond between humans and horses holds transformative power. Nestled along the scenic St. Vrain corridor in Longmont, Colorado, our ranch exists at the intersection of two profound callings — the healing of the human spirit and the preservation of magnificent heritage draft horse breeds.

Founded by Dr. Kirk Mitchell, a physician who has witnessed firsthand the limitations of conventional medicine, Meadowlark Ranch was born from the belief that nature, and especially horses, can reach places that clinical interventions alone cannot.

## A Place for Healing

There is a quiet intelligence in a horse's gaze — an ability to sense what lies beneath the surface of human composure. At Meadowlark Ranch, we harness this extraordinary sensitivity through our equine-assisted therapy programs, offering individuals a pathway to emotional restoration that transcends traditional therapeutic models.

Our healing programs serve cancer survivors, veterans, first responders, and anyone carrying the weight of life's most difficult chapters. In partnership with **Hope Held By A Horse**, we provide free equine-assisted healing sessions for cancer survivors, ensuring that financial barriers never stand between a person and the peace they deserve.

Under the careful guidance of our trained facilitators, participants engage in ground-based interactions with our horses — grooming, leading, and simply being present with these gentle giants. The results speak for themselves: reduced anxiety, renewed confidence, and a restored sense of connection to something greater than oneself.

## A Legacy of Horses

The second pillar of our mission addresses a quiet crisis in the equestrian world: the declining populations of heritage draft horse breeds. Once the backbone of American agriculture and industry, breeds like the Percheron and the Shire now face uncertain futures as their numbers dwindle.

Meadowlark Ranch is committed to the preservation and celebration of these extraordinary animals. Through our **CCP Percherons** program, we maintain and compete a premier string of Percheron horses, including an elite six-horse hitch that represents the pinnacle of draft horse tradition. Our Percherons compete across the Western States Classic circuit and at the National Western Stock Show, serving as living ambassadors for their breed.

Every horse in our care is treated not as livestock, but as a partner in a shared legacy — one that stretches back centuries and, through our stewardship, will extend far into the future.

## Our Vision for the Future

We envision Meadowlark Ranch as a beacon for what is possible when compassion, tradition, and excellence converge. Our long-term goals include:

- **Expanding our healing programs** to serve a broader population, including at-risk youth and families navigating grief and loss
- **Growing the CCP Percherons herd** to ensure genetic diversity and breed vitality for generations to come
- **Establishing an educational center** where visitors can learn about heritage breeds, sustainable ranching, and the science behind equine-assisted therapy
- **Deepening our community partnerships** to create a network of support that extends well beyond our fence lines
- **Pioneering research** into the measurable impacts of equine-assisted healing, contributing to the growing body of evidence that supports this transformative practice

The road ahead is long, but the hoofbeats that mark our path are steady. At Meadowlark Ranch, the future is bright — and it is carried forward by the most noble of companions.
