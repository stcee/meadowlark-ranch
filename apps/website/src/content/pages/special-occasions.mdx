## Milestones Deserve Magnificence

Some moments in life call for more than a restaurant reservation. They call for a setting that matches the magnitude of the occasion — a place where the beauty of the landscape, the warmth of genuine hospitality, and the thoughtfulness of every detail combine to create an experience that lives in memory long after the last guest has departed.

Meadowlark Ranch is that place. Set against the breathtaking backdrop of the Flatiron Mountains in Longmont, Colorado, our properties offer a venue of extraordinary versatility and timeless elegance for life's most important celebrations.

## Occasions We Celebrate

### Anniversaries

Whether you are marking your tenth anniversary with an intimate dinner for two or celebrating fifty years with a gathering of family and friends, Meadowlark Ranch provides a setting that honors the journey of a shared life. Toast to the years behind you and the years ahead with mountain views, exceptional cuisine, and the quiet magic of a Colorado ranch at sunset.

### Milestone Birthdays

Turning 40, 50, 60, or any age worth celebrating calls for something beyond the ordinary. Host your milestone birthday at the ranch with a custom-designed party that reflects who you are — whether that means an elegant garden soiree, a rustic barn celebration, or an adventurous afternoon that includes meeting our Percheron horses up close.

### Family Reunions

Bring the whole family together in a place that encourages connection. Meadowlark Ranch offers ample space for multi-generational gatherings, with outdoor activities, scenic grounds for children to explore, and gathering spaces where stories can be shared and bonds renewed. There is no better place to remind a family of what it means to be together.

### Celebrations of Life

When we gather to honor a life well-lived, the setting matters deeply. Meadowlark Ranch provides a place of natural beauty and tranquility for celebrations of life — a space where grief can coexist with gratitude, and where the landscape itself offers comfort. Our horse-drawn carriage service is available for processions, adding a touch of timeless dignity to the occasion.

### Retirement Celebrations

A career's worth of achievement deserves recognition in a setting that reflects its significance. Honor the retiree in your life with a gathering at the ranch — complete with heartfelt toasts, exceptional food, and the unforgettable experience of a working Colorado equestrian estate.

### Engagement Parties

Begin the journey to your wedding day with a celebration at the place where it all comes together. An engagement party at Meadowlark Ranch sets the tone for everything that follows — elegant, warm, and distinctly Colorado.
