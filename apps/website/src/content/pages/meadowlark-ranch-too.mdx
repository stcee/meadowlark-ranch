## Purpose-Built for Greatness

When Dr. Kirk Mitchell established the CCP Percherons program in 2024, it was clear from the outset that these extraordinary horses deserved an extraordinary facility — a place designed from the ground up to meet the specialized demands of elite draft horse care, training, and competition preparation.

**Meadowlark Ranch Too**, located at **10500 N 49th Street, Longmont, CO 80503**, is that facility. Purpose-built for the CCP Percherons string, it represents a significant investment in the future of heritage Percheron preservation and competition excellence in the western United States.

## A Facility Designed for Draft Horses

Standard equine facilities are built for standard-sized horses. Percherons are anything but standard. Standing 16 to 19 hands tall and weighing between 1,800 and 2,600 pounds, these magnificent animals require infrastructure that accommodates their size, strength, and specific care needs.

Every element of Meadowlark Ranch Too was designed with the Percheron in mind.

### Custom Draft Horse Stalls

Our primary barn features **custom-built stalls** engineered specifically for draft horses:

- **Oversized dimensions** that provide ample room for even the largest Percherons to stand, lie down, and move comfortably
- **Reinforced construction** using heavy-gauge materials rated for the strength and weight of draft breeds
- **Superior ventilation systems** that maintain optimal air quality and temperature regulation
- **Rubber matting and premium bedding** for joint health and comfort
- **Individual water and feed stations** designed for the elevated feed intake of working draft horses
- **Wide aisles and doorways** that allow safe, stress-free movement of horses throughout the facility

### New Horse Barn

A dedicated secondary barn serves multiple critical functions:

- **Feed room** — Climate-controlled storage for premium hay, grain, and supplements, organized for efficient daily feeding operations
- **Wash racks** — Oversized wash stations with hot and cold water, designed for bathing and grooming draft horses in preparation for shows and daily care
- **Tack and harness storage** — Secure, organized storage for the extensive harness sets, show equipment, and tack required by a full competition program
- **Veterinary area** — A designated space for routine veterinary care, farrier visits, and health monitoring

### Outdoor Training Arena

Preparing a six-horse hitch for competition demands space — and not just any space. Our outdoor training arena was designed to replicate the dimensions and conditions of a competition ring:

- **Full-sized arena** with professional footing designed for the weight and impact of draft horses
- **Adequate turning radius** for six- and eight-horse hitch maneuvers
- **Perimeter fencing** rated for draft horse containment
- **Lighting** for early morning and evening training sessions when the competition season demands extended hours
- **Spectator-safe viewing areas** for visitors and guests observing training

### Six-Horse Hitch Practice Area

The six-horse hitch is the centerpiece of the CCP Percherons competition program, and it requires a dedicated practice environment:

- **Hitching area** with space to safely hitch and unhitch six horses simultaneously
- **Practice course** that simulates show-ring patterns, including the figure-eight, the lineup, and the reverse
- **Room for the full show wagon** and the clearances required for competition-style driving
- **Safe entry and exit lanes** that prevent congestion and allow each horse to be managed individually during the hitching process

### Guest Viewing Areas

Meadowlark Ranch Too welcomes visitors by appointment, and we have designed dedicated spaces where guests can observe the training process safely and comfortably:

- **Covered viewing platforms** adjacent to the training arena
- **Comfortable seating** with unobstructed sightlines to all practice areas
- **Interpretive signage** that helps visitors understand what they are watching and the level of skill involved
- **Safe distances** maintained between guests and working horses at all times

## The CCP Percherons String

The horses that call Meadowlark Ranch Too home are among the finest Percherons in the western United States. Each was selected by Dr. Mitchell and evaluated by Wilbur Helmuth for the qualities that define an elite competition horse:

- **Conformation** that meets or exceeds Percheron breed standards
- **Temperament** that combines the calm confidence essential for show-ring performance with the drive and energy needed for hitch work
- **Color and consistency** — the CCP string is composed of matched black Percherons, creating the dramatic visual impact that distinguishes a premier hitch
- **Soundness and athleticism** that can withstand the physical demands of training and a full competition season

## Daily Life at the Facility

A typical day at Meadowlark Ranch Too reflects the discipline and dedication required to maintain a world-class draft horse program:

- **Early morning** — Feeding, health checks, and turnout for exercise
- **Mid-morning** — Individual training sessions, groundwork, and conditioning
- **Midday** — Grooming, farrier and veterinary appointments, equipment maintenance
- **Afternoon** — Hitch training and team practice in the arena
- **Evening** — Final feeding, stall checks, and facility maintenance

This routine is maintained year-round, with intensity increasing as the competition season approaches and adjustments made to protect the horses during the hottest and coldest months.

## Founded on a Vision

Meadowlark Ranch Too exists because Dr. Kirk Mitchell understands a fundamental truth about heritage breed preservation: it is not enough to simply keep the animals alive. They must be given the opportunity to thrive — to be trained, conditioned, shown, and celebrated at the highest levels. Only by demonstrating the extraordinary capabilities of the Percheron can we inspire the next generation of breeders, owners, and enthusiasts to carry the torch forward.

This facility is not just a barn. It is a statement of commitment — to the Percheron breed, to the craft of horsemanship, and to the belief that some traditions are worth every ounce of effort required to preserve them.
