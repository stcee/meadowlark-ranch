## Exceptional Events, Effortlessly Executed

Behind every extraordinary event is a team that sweats the details so you do not have to. At Meadowlark Ranch, our event services and planning team brings years of experience, a deep network of trusted vendors, and an unwavering commitment to excellence to every celebration we host.

Whether you are envisioning an intimate gathering for 30 or a grand affair for 200, our planners ensure that every element — from the first welcome to the final farewell — reflects the quality, warmth, and distinctive character of Meadowlark Ranch.

## Full-Service Event Coordination

Our planning services are designed to guide you through every phase of your event, transforming your vision into a seamless, stress-free reality.

### Discovery & Consultation

Every event begins with a conversation. During our initial consultation, we take the time to understand your vision, your priorities, your guest list, and the atmosphere you want to create. This is where the broad strokes are laid down — the foundation upon which every subsequent decision will rest.

### Venue Selection & Configuration

Meadowlark Ranch offers a variety of indoor and outdoor spaces, each with its own character and capacity. Our team will walk you through every option, helping you select and configure the spaces that best serve your event's needs:

- **Outdoor ceremony and gathering areas** with mountain views
- **Climate-controlled indoor reception spaces** with flexible layouts
- **Intimate garden settings** for smaller, more personal affairs
- **Expansive grounds** for events that require room to breathe

We design custom floor plans for every event, ensuring optimal flow, comfort, and visual impact.

### Vendor Management

Over the years, Meadowlark Ranch has cultivated relationships with Boulder County's most talented and reliable vendors. Our team coordinates all vendor communications, contracts, and logistics, including:

- **Catering and culinary services** — from farm-to-table dinners to casual Colorado cuisine
- **Floral design and decor** — arrangements that complement the natural beauty of the ranch
- **Photography and videography** — professionals who know how to capture the ranch at its best
- **Entertainment** — live musicians, DJs, ensembles, and specialty performers
- **Rentals** — specialty furniture, lighting, tableware, and custom installations
- **Transportation** — shuttle services, valet parking, and of course, our signature horse-drawn carriages

You are always welcome to bring your own preferred vendors. We work seamlessly with outside professionals to ensure a cohesive experience.

### Custom Decor & Design

The natural beauty of Meadowlark Ranch provides an extraordinary canvas. Our design services help you enhance that canvas with elements that express your personal style:

- **Tablescapes and place settings** crafted to your color palette and aesthetic
- **Lighting design** from golden-hour ambiance to dramatic evening illumination
- **Signage and wayfinding** that guide guests with elegance
- **Centerpieces and installations** that anchor each space with visual impact
- **Seasonal accents** that celebrate the time of year and the Colorado landscape

### Catering Coordination

Food is at the heart of hospitality. Our team works with you and our catering partners to develop menus that are as memorable as the occasion itself:

- **Tasting sessions** to refine your menu selections
- **Dietary accommodation** for guests with allergies, restrictions, or preferences
- **Bar program design** including craft cocktails, local wines, Colorado craft beers, and non-alcoholic options
- **Service style selection** — plated, buffet, family-style, food stations, or passed hors d'oeuvres
- **Cake and dessert coordination** with local bakeries and pastry artists

### Timeline Management

A great event feels effortless to the guests because every transition, every moment, and every cue has been precisely planned. Our team develops a comprehensive timeline for your event and manages its execution minute by minute:

- **Pre-event setup coordination** ensuring every vendor arrives, sets up, and is ready on schedule
- **Guest arrival management** including parking, welcome beverages, and wayfinding
- **Ceremony and program flow** with precise cueing for speakers, musicians, and participants
- **Reception transitions** from cocktail hour to dinner to dancing, each shift feeling natural and unhurried
- **End-of-evening logistics** including send-offs, transportation coordination, and vendor breakdown

### Day-of Coordination

On the day of your event, our coordinator is your single point of contact — the person who ensures that every plan is executed flawlessly while you remain free to be fully present in the moment. Day-of services include:

- **Vendor check-in and management** from first arrival to final departure
- **Timeline execution** with real-time adjustments as needed
- **Problem resolution** — handling any issue that arises so you never have to know it existed
- **Guest assistance** for questions, directions, and special needs
- **Post-event breakdown coordination** leaving the ranch exactly as it was found

## Our Promise

At Meadowlark Ranch, we believe that event planning should be a joy, not a burden. Our team exists to carry the weight of logistics, coordination, and execution so that you can carry the joy of the occasion itself. From your first phone call to the moment the last lantern is extinguished, we are beside you — attentive, prepared, and committed to making your event extraordinary.
