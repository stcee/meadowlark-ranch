## Safe Passage for Your Most Valuable Cargo

Transporting a horse is an act of trust. You are entrusting a living, breathing partner — an animal that may be irreplaceable in both monetary and emotional terms — to someone else's care, equipment, and judgment. At Meadowlark Ranch, we understand the weight of that trust, and we honor it with every mile.

Our **professional horse transport and hauling services** are available across Colorado and the surrounding Rocky Mountain states, providing safe, stress-free transportation for horses of all breeds and sizes — with particular expertise in the specialized requirements of large draft breeds.

## Our Transport Capabilities

### Climate-Controlled Trailers

Colorado's climate ranges from scorching summer heat on the eastern plains to bitter winter cold in the mountain passes. Our transport fleet features:

- **Climate management systems** that maintain comfortable temperatures regardless of external conditions
- **Superior ventilation** with adjustable airflow to prevent overheating and ensure fresh air circulation throughout transit
- **Insulated construction** that buffers against temperature extremes
- **Non-slip flooring** with rubber matting for secure footing during transit
- **Padded dividers and walls** to protect against bumps and shifts during transport

### Experienced Handlers

The quality of a transport service is defined not by the trailer, but by the people driving it and managing the horses inside:

- **Professionally trained transport handlers** who understand equine behavior and stress management during transit
- **Experienced drivers** with thousands of miles of safe horse hauling across Colorado's diverse terrain — from interstate highways to mountain passes
- **Loading and unloading expertise** that prioritizes your horse's calm and confidence at every transition point
- **Real-time communication** — we keep you informed of departure, progress, and arrival throughout the transport

### Insurance Coverage

- **Comprehensive transport insurance** covering your horse during transit
- **Liability coverage** for loading, unloading, and all aspects of the transport process
- **Documentation** provided to owners prior to transport for full transparency

### Overnight Layover Options

For longer transports, we offer:

- **Planned layover stops** at trusted equine facilities along the route
- **Overnight stabling** with feed, water, and turnout at layover locations
- **Health monitoring** throughout extended transports, with veterinary contacts available at every stop
- **Flexible scheduling** that prioritizes your horse's comfort over arrival speed

## Specialized Draft Breed Transport

As the operators of the CCP Percherons competition program, Meadowlark Ranch has extensive experience transporting horses that most haulers are simply not equipped to handle. Draft horse transport presents unique challenges:

- **Weight capacity** — A single Percheron can weigh 2,600 pounds. A six-horse hitch string weighs nearly six tons. Our trailers and tow vehicles are rated for these loads.
- **Clearance requirements** — Draft horses standing 17 to 19 hands require trailers with sufficient headroom. Our equipment accommodates the tallest draft breeds without forcing them into cramped or uncomfortable positions.
- **Loading logistics** — Loading a draft horse safely requires wider ramps, reinforced loading equipment, and handlers who are comfortable working with animals of exceptional size and strength.
- **Specialized tie systems** — Our trailers feature tie systems designed for the power of draft breeds, preventing breakaways while allowing safe range of motion.

Whether you need to transport a single horse across town or move a full competition string across state lines, our draft breed transport capabilities are unmatched in the region.

## Service Area

## Types of Transport We Provide

### Competition Transport

Our core transport expertise. We move our own CCP Percherons competition string to shows across the Western States Classic circuit and to the National Western Stock Show. This same level of show-day precision is available to competition clients who need their horses delivered to events in peak condition and on schedule.

### Relocation Transport

Moving to a new farm, boarding facility, or state? We provide full-service relocation transport with careful attention to the stress that a major move can place on a horse. We coordinate timing, plan routes that minimize stress, and ensure your horse arrives calm and comfortable.

### Veterinary & Emergency Transport

When your horse needs to reach a veterinary hospital or specialist facility, time matters. We offer priority scheduling for veterinary transport, with experienced handlers who understand the additional care required when transporting a horse that may be in distress or recovering from medical treatment.

### Seasonal & Event Transport

From summer pasture rotations to transport to and from breeding facilities, training centers, or seasonal events, we provide reliable, scheduled transport services that fit your calendar.

## How It Works

1. **Contact us** with your transport needs — origin, destination, number of horses, breed and size, and your preferred timeline
2. **Receive a customized quote** based on distance, number of horses, and any special requirements
3. **Confirm your booking** with our transport coordinator, who will finalize all logistics

## Our Commitment

Every horse that travels with Meadowlark Ranch is treated exactly as we treat our own. That means no shortcuts, no compromises on safety, and no detail too small to attend to. Your horse's well-being is not just our responsibility — it is our reputation.
