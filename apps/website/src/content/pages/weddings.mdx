## Where Love Meets the Landscape

There are places that simply elevate a moment — where the beauty of the setting amplifies the beauty of the occasion until the two become inseparable in memory. **Meadowlark Ranch** is one of those places.

Nestled along the St. Vrain corridor in Longmont, Colorado, with the Flatiron Mountains rising in majestic silhouette to the west, Meadowlark Ranch offers couples a wedding venue of uncommon beauty and distinction. Here, against a canvas of open sky and rolling pasture, surrounded by the quiet grandeur of heritage Percheron horses and the warmth of a working Colorado ranch, two lives become one.

## A Venue Unlike Any Other

Meadowlark Ranch is not a converted ballroom or a generic event space. It is a living, breathing estate where every element — from the century-old cottonwoods to the meticulously maintained grounds — contributes to an atmosphere of authentic elegance.

### Outdoor Ceremony Spaces

Exchange your vows beneath the Colorado sky, with the Rocky Mountains as your witness. Our outdoor ceremony areas offer:

- **Mountain-view meadow** — A sweeping, manicured lawn framed by the Flatirons and the Continental Divide, perfect for ceremonies of any size
- **Garden alcove** — An intimate, flower-framed setting for smaller ceremonies, surrounded by native plantings and the gentle sound of birdsong
- **Creekside setting** — A romantic streamside location along the St. Vrain corridor, where the soft murmur of water accompanies your vows

### Indoor Reception Spaces

When the celebration moves inside, our reception venues combine rustic charm with refined sophistication:

- **Climate-controlled event spaces** that ensure comfort in every season
- **Elegant lighting** that transforms as the evening unfolds, from golden hour warmth to starlit ambiance
- **Flexible floor plans** that accommodate intimate gatherings of 50 and grand celebrations of up to **200 guests**
- **State-of-the-art sound and lighting systems** for speeches, toasts, and dancing into the night

## The Horse-Drawn Carriage Arrival

No wedding at Meadowlark Ranch is complete without the signature experience: a **horse-drawn carriage arrival** drawn by our magnificent Percheron horses. Imagine the moment — the murmur of guests, the distant clip of hooves on stone, and then the breathtaking sight of a polished carriage drawn by matched black Percherons rounding the drive.

This is not a novelty. It is a tradition that connects your celebration to centuries of elegance, and it is an experience your guests will never forget.
