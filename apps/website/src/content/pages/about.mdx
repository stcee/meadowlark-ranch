## Welcome to Meadowlark Ranch

Where the foothills of the Rocky Mountains meet the open prairie of Colorado's Front Range, a place of uncommon beauty and purpose awaits. **Meadowlark Ranch** is a premier equestrian estate in Longmont, Colorado, where heritage horse preservation, equine-assisted healing, and world-class events converge against the stunning backdrop of Boulder County.

Founded by **Dr. Kirk Mitchell**, a physician whose reverence for horses and commitment to holistic wellness inspired a vision unlike any other in the region, Meadowlark Ranch operates across two carefully curated properties, each designed to serve a distinct facet of our mission.

## A Dual Mission

At the heart of Meadowlark Ranch lies a dual commitment that defines everything we do:

**Healing through horses.** Our equine-assisted therapy programs provide a pathway to emotional restoration for cancer survivors, veterans, first responders, and anyone seeking healing beyond the walls of a clinic. In partnership with Hope Held By A Horse, we offer free sessions for cancer survivors — because access to healing should never depend on ability to pay.

**Preserving heritage breeds.** Through our CCP Percherons program, we champion the preservation of the Percheron — one of the world's most magnificent and historically significant draft horse breeds. Our elite competition string, including a six-horse hitch, competes across the Western States Classic circuit, carrying forward a tradition that stretches back centuries.

## Boulder County's Premier Event Destination

Meadowlark Ranch is more than a working equestrian estate — it is one of Northern Colorado's most sought-after event venues. From elegant weddings beneath the Flatiron Mountains to corporate retreats that transform how teams work together, our properties offer:

- **Wedding celebrations** for up to 200 guests with horse-drawn carriage arrivals
- **Corporate retreats and team-building** featuring equine-informed leadership development
- **Private events** including milestone celebrations, holiday gatherings, and intimate dinner parties
- **Carriage services** for weddings, parades, celebrations of life, and scenic rides

Every event at Meadowlark Ranch is supported by a dedicated planning team that ensures each detail reflects the quality and care for which the ranch is known.

## Our Team

The people behind Meadowlark Ranch bring a rare combination of expertise, passion, and dedication to their work:

- **Dr. Kirk Mitchell** — Founder, physician, and driving force behind CCP Percherons
- **Wilbur Helmuth** — Head trainer with deep Amish heritage horse traditions
- **Makenna Helmuth** — Assistant trainer and rising star in the draft horse world

Together, this team ensures that every horse receives exceptional care and every visitor experiences the warmth and professionalism that define Meadowlark Ranch.

## Our Horses

The horses of Meadowlark Ranch are its beating heart. Our herd includes:

- **CCP Percherons** — An elite string of black Percherons bred and trained for competition at the highest levels
- **Heritage Shires** — Gentle giants that honor the ranch's founding mission of Shire horse preservation
- **Therapy horses** — Specially selected and trained equines who facilitate our healing programs

Each horse is known by name, cared for individually, and treated as the extraordinary partner it is.

## Two Exceptional Properties

**Meadowlark Ranch** at 5384 St. Vrain Road is the original homestead — a scenic property along the St. Vrain corridor featuring event venues, therapy spaces, and heritage horse facilities, all framed by panoramic views of the Flatiron Mountains.

**Meadowlark Ranch Too** at 10500 N 49th Street is our purpose-built Percheron facility, featuring state-of-the-art barns, a training arena, and a six-horse hitch practice area designed specifically for the demands of elite draft horse competition.

## Committed to Stewardship

Meadowlark Ranch is powered by solar energy, maintains designated bird sanctuaries, and practices sustainable land management across every acre. Our commitment to the land is as deep as our commitment to the horses and people we serve.

## Your Invitation

Meadowlark Ranch is not simply a place — it is an experience. We invite you to explore our programs, attend an event, or simply drive out to the ranch and feel the particular peace that comes from standing beside a two-thousand-pound horse as the sun sets behind the Rockies.

This is Meadowlark Ranch. This is where healing, heritage, and hospitality meet.
