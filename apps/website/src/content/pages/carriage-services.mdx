## The Art of Arrival

In a world that moves at the speed of algorithms and instant gratification, there is something profoundly powerful about slowing down — about the measured rhythm of hooves on pavement, the creak of polished wood, and the sight of matched Percherons moving in perfect unison. A horse-drawn carriage does not simply transport you from one place to another. It transforms the journey itself into an event.

Meadowlark Ranch's **carriage services** offer this extraordinary experience for weddings, parades, celebrations of life, holiday events, photo shoots, and scenic rides throughout Boulder County and Northern Colorado.

## Our Carriages & Horses

Our carriage fleet is drawn by the magnificent **CCP Percherons** — among the finest draft horses in the western United States. These are not rental horses from an anonymous stable. They are the same elite Percherons that compete on the Western States Classic circuit, handled by the same expert team that trains them daily.

Each carriage outing is managed by our professional drivers, trained in the art of driving draft horses with precision, grace, and an unwavering commitment to safety. Our equipment is meticulously maintained, our horses are immaculately presented, and every detail — from the polish on the harness brass to the fresh flowers on the carriage — is attended to with care.

## Wedding Carriages

The signature Meadowlark Ranch wedding experience begins before the bride ever reaches the altar. Our **wedding carriage service** offers:

- **Grand arrival** — The bride, couple, or entire wedding party arrives via horse-drawn carriage, creating a moment of breathtaking anticipation for assembled guests
- **Departure in style** — Following the ceremony, the newlyweds depart in the carriage for photographs or a private moment together before the reception
- **Guest experience** — Carriage rides between ceremony and reception venues, or during cocktail hour for guests to enjoy
- **Photo opportunities** — The carriage and Percherons provide an unparalleled backdrop for wedding photography

Our wedding carriages are available as part of a Meadowlark Ranch wedding package or as a standalone service for weddings at other venues in the region.

## Parade & Community Events

Few sights stir civic pride and community joy quite like a team of Percherons drawing a decorated carriage down Main Street. Meadowlark Ranch provides carriage and hitch services for:

- **Holiday parades** — Christmas, Fourth of July, and seasonal celebrations
- **Community festivals** — Longmont, Boulder, and Northern Colorado events
- **Civic ceremonies** — Grand openings, dedications, and municipal celebrations
- **Charitable events** — Fundraising galas, awareness campaigns, and community benefit occasions

Our parade appearances are always crowd favorites, and our team works closely with event organizers to ensure seamless integration into parade routes and event logistics.

## Celebrations of Life & Funerals

When we honor those who have passed, every detail carries weight. A horse-drawn carriage procession offers a measure of dignity, solemnity, and timeless grace that no motorized vehicle can replicate.

Meadowlark Ranch provides **carriage services for celebrations of life and funeral processions**, offering:

- **Processional carriage** — Bearing the casket or urn with quiet dignity
- **Family carriage** — Transporting immediate family members
- **Cortege coordination** — Working with funeral directors to integrate the carriage seamlessly into the service
- **Custom arrangements** — Floral decorations, pace coordination, and route planning

These services are provided with the utmost sensitivity and respect, honoring both the departed and the loved ones they leave behind.

## Holiday & Seasonal Experiences

During the holiday season and throughout the year, Meadowlark Ranch offers **scenic carriage rides** that celebrate the beauty of Colorado's Front Range:

- **Holiday rides** — Experience the magic of a winter evening from the warmth of a blanket-wrapped carriage, with the Percherons in their finest seasonal regalia
- **Autumn foliage rides** — Glide through the golden cottonwood corridors along the St. Vrain
- **Springtime meadow rides** — Enjoy the wildflower bloom and mountain views as winter gives way to renewal
- **Summer sunset rides** — Watch the sun set behind the Flatirons from a vantage point that feels like a painting come to life

## Photo Shoots & Production

The combination of magnificent Percherons, a polished carriage, and the Meadowlark Ranch landscape creates an irresistible setting for professional photography and film production:

- **Engagement and bridal photo sessions** with the carriage and horses
- **Family portrait sessions** in a setting of timeless elegance
- **Commercial photography and video production** featuring the hitch
- **Editorial and magazine shoots** that capture the spirit of the American West

Our team works with photographers and production crews to ensure that the horses and equipment are positioned, lit, and presented to their best advantage.

## The Scenic St. Vrain Corridor

All of our carriage services take place against the backdrop of one of Boulder County's most beautiful landscapes. The St. Vrain corridor offers:

- **Panoramic views of the Flatiron Mountains** and the Continental Divide
- **Mature cottonwood groves** that frame the road in dappled light
- **Open meadows** where meadowlarks and raptors glide on the updrafts
- **The quiet, pastoral atmosphere** of Colorado's agricultural heritage

This is not a city block loop. This is a genuine Colorado experience, drawn by genuine Colorado horses, along one of the most beautiful roads in the state.

## Safety & Professionalism

Every carriage outing is conducted under the supervision of our professionally trained drivers. We maintain comprehensive insurance coverage, follow all applicable regulations, and prioritize the safety of our guests, our horses, and the public at all times. Our horses are conditioned for public environments and are calm, reliable, and accustomed to the sights and sounds of events and roadways.
