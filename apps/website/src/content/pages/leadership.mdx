## The People Behind the Mission

Behind every great horse is a great horseman. Behind every great ranch is a team of individuals whose shared passion, expertise, and unwavering dedication make the extraordinary possible. At Meadowlark Ranch, our leadership team brings together medicine, horsemanship, and a deep reverence for heritage breeds to create something truly exceptional in Boulder County.

## Dr. Kirk Mitchell — Founder & Visionary

Dr. Kirk Mitchell is the founder and driving force behind Meadowlark Ranch and CCP Percherons. A practicing physician by training, Dr. Mitchell brings a unique perspective to the equestrian world — one that sees horses not merely as animals to be admired, but as partners in healing and ambassadors for breeds that deserve to endure.

Dr. Mitchell's journey with horses began long before medical school, rooted in a childhood spent around working farms and a fascination with the power and grace of draft breeds. That early passion never waned. When the opportunity arose to establish a ranch dedicated to both heritage horse preservation and equine-assisted therapy, Dr. Mitchell committed himself fully — investing not only his resources but his considerable energy and vision into creating a program that could compete at the national level while simultaneously serving those in need of healing.

Under Dr. Mitchell's leadership, CCP Percherons has grown into one of the premier Percheron programs in the western United States, with a competition string that includes an elite six-horse hitch. His physician's eye for detail, combined with his horseman's instinct, ensures that every animal in the program receives care that is both scientifically informed and deeply compassionate.

## Wilbur Helmuth — Head Trainer

Wilbur Helmuth serves as Head Trainer at Meadowlark Ranch, bringing a lifetime of draft horse expertise rooted in the rich equestrian traditions of the Amish community. In a world where horsemanship is increasingly mechanized and commodified, Wilbur represents something rare and invaluable: an unbroken lineage of knowledge passed down through generations of people for whom the horse was not a hobby, but a way of life.

Wilbur's skill with draft horses is immediately apparent to anyone who watches him work. There is an ease and confidence in his handling that speaks to thousands of hours spent alongside these animals — reading their body language, understanding their temperament, and earning their trust through patience rather than force. His expertise spans the full spectrum of draft horse disciplines, from ground training and conditioning to the exacting art of driving a six-horse hitch.

As Head Trainer, Wilbur is responsible for the daily training regimen of the CCP Percherons competition string, preparing horses and crews for the demands of the Western States Classic circuit and other premier events. His Amish heritage informs an approach to horsemanship that prizes consistency, respect, and an almost intuitive connection between handler and horse.

## Makenna Helmuth — Assistant Trainer

Makenna Helmuth serves as Assistant Trainer at Meadowlark Ranch, representing the next generation of draft horse excellence. Working alongside her father Wilbur, Makenna has absorbed a lifetime of equine knowledge while bringing her own energy, perspective, and growing expertise to the CCP Percherons program.

Makenna's presence on the team reflects Meadowlark Ranch's commitment to developing the next generation of draft horse professionals. In an industry where experienced handlers are increasingly rare, her dedication to mastering the craft of draft horse training and competition is both personally impressive and vitally important to the future of the discipline.

Her responsibilities include daily horse care and conditioning, assisting with hitch training, and supporting the competition team at events across the Western States Classic circuit. Makenna's natural rapport with the horses and her willingness to embrace the demanding work of draft horse management have made her an indispensable member of the Meadowlark team.

## A Team United by Purpose

What distinguishes the Meadowlark Ranch leadership team is not simply their individual expertise — it is the shared sense of purpose that binds them together. Dr. Mitchell's medical background and visionary leadership, Wilbur's generational horsemanship, and Makenna's youthful energy and dedication combine to create a team that is greater than the sum of its parts.

Together, they ensure that every horse at Meadowlark Ranch receives world-class care, every competition appearance reflects the highest standards of the discipline, and every visitor to the ranch experiences the warmth and professionalism that define this exceptional place.
