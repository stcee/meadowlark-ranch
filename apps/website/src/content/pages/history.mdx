## A Story Written in Hoofprints

Every great endeavor begins with a single, unwavering conviction. For Meadowlark Ranch, that conviction was simple yet profound: that heritage horses deserve champions, and that the land we steward deserves our deepest respect. What began as a quiet dream along Colorado's Front Range has grown into one of Boulder County's most distinctive destinations — a place where history is honored, healing is offered, and the future is being shaped one hoofbeat at a time.

## The Early Years: Meadowlark Shires

The story of Meadowlark Ranch begins under a different name. In its earliest days, the property at 5384 St. Vrain Road in Longmont was known as **Meadowlark Shires** — a name that reflected its founding purpose: the preservation and breeding of Shire horses, one of the world's largest and most imperiled draft breeds.

The Shire, with its feathered legs and gentle temperament, had once powered the farms, mills, and dray wagons of England and colonial America. By the late twentieth century, the breed's numbers had fallen to critically low levels. Meadowlark Shires was established as a sanctuary and breeding program dedicated to ensuring these magnificent animals would not vanish from the earth.

During this period, the ranch developed its foundational infrastructure — barns designed to accommodate the extraordinary stature of draft horses, pastures managed for optimal nutrition, and a culture of care that treated every animal as an irreplaceable treasure.

## A New Chapter: Meadowlark Integrated Healing

As the ranch matured, Dr. Kirk Mitchell — a physician with a deep appreciation for holistic approaches to wellness — recognized an extraordinary opportunity. The same qualities that made the Shires exceptional preservation subjects also made them powerful partners in healing.

The ranch evolved into **Meadowlark Integrated Healing**, expanding its mission to encompass equine-assisted therapy programs. Working alongside licensed therapists and certified equine specialists, the ranch began offering ground-based healing sessions for individuals navigating cancer recovery, PTSD, grief, and other life challenges.

The horses, with their innate sensitivity and non-judgmental presence, proved to be extraordinary facilitators of emotional breakthroughs. Participants who had struggled for months or years in conventional therapeutic settings found that a single afternoon with a horse could shift something deep within them.

## Embracing Solar: A Commitment to the Land (2020)

In 2020, Meadowlark Ranch made a decisive commitment to environmental stewardship by transitioning to **solar power**. The installation of a comprehensive solar array across the property marked a turning point — the ranch would no longer simply occupy the land but would actively work to protect it.

This investment reflected a core belief: that the same ethic of care extended to the horses must also extend to the earth beneath their hooves. The solar transition reduced the ranch's carbon footprint dramatically and positioned Meadowlark as a leader in sustainable ranching practices along Colorado's Front Range.

## The Arrival of CCP Percherons (2024)

The year 2024 brought one of the most significant developments in the ranch's history: the establishment of the **CCP Percherons** program. Under Dr. Mitchell's leadership, the ranch acquired a string of elite Percheron horses and committed to competing at the highest levels of draft horse competition.

The Percheron — France's gift to the equine world — is renowned for its power, elegance, and versatility. CCP Percherons quickly distinguished themselves on the Western States Classic circuit, with the ranch's six-horse hitch becoming a crowd favorite at shows across Colorado, Arizona, and beyond.

The addition of Percherons to the ranch's heritage breed program deepened its conservation impact, ensuring that two of the world's most important draft breeds would find refuge and celebration at Meadowlark.

## Meadowlark Ranch Too (2024)

Growth demanded new space. In 2024, Dr. Mitchell established **Meadowlark Ranch Too**, a state-of-the-art equine facility located at 10500 N 49th Street in Longmont. Purpose-built for the CCP Percherons program, the new facility features custom draft horse stalls, a modern horse barn with dedicated feed rooms and wash racks, an outdoor training arena, and a six-horse hitch practice area.

Meadowlark Ranch Too represents the next generation of draft horse facilities — designed from the ground up to meet the specialized needs of these extraordinary animals while providing world-class training and competition preparation capabilities.

## Meadowlark Ranch Today

Today, Meadowlark Ranch stands as a testament to what is possible when passion is paired with purpose. Across two locations in Longmont, the ranch operates a comprehensive equine program, hosts weddings and corporate events against the backdrop of the Flatiron Mountains, provides professional horse boarding and transport services, and continues its vital work in equine-assisted healing.

The name has changed, the herd has grown, and the mission has deepened — but the heart of Meadowlark Ranch remains exactly what it was from the very first day: an abiding love for horses and an unwavering commitment to the people and land they share this corner of Colorado with.
