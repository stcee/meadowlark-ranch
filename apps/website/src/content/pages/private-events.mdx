## Gather in Extraordinary Fashion

Some occasions do not fit neatly into a category. They are not quite weddings, not precisely corporate — they are simply gatherings of people who matter, held in a place that makes the gathering feel significant. At Meadowlark Ranch, we specialize in these moments: the uncategorizable celebrations that deserve just as much care and creativity as any formal affair.

Our private events program offers the full resources of the ranch — our stunning venues, our dedicated planning team, our catering partnerships, and the incomparable atmosphere of a working Colorado equestrian estate — for whatever occasion brings you to our door.

## The Occasions We Host

### Custom Gatherings

Perhaps you are reuniting with old friends. Perhaps you are hosting a group of collectors, enthusiasts, or fellow travelers who share a passion. Perhaps the occasion is simply that life is short and the people you love deserve to be gathered in a beautiful place. Whatever brings your group together, we will create a setting worthy of the connection.

### Milestone Celebrations

Life is marked by milestones that deserve recognition: a child's graduation, a promotion, a recovery, a new chapter. These deeply personal occasions call for a venue that matches their emotional significance — intimate enough to feel personal, grand enough to feel celebratory.

### Holiday Parties

Elevate your holiday gathering beyond the expected. Host your Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year's, or any seasonal celebration at the ranch with:

- **Festive decor** tailored to the season and your aesthetic
- **Catered holiday menus** featuring the finest seasonal cuisine
- **Scenic carriage rides** through the winter landscape
- **Fireside gatherings** with warm beverages and the glow of the season
- **Live music or entertainment** to set the perfect mood

### Dinner Parties

For those who believe that a truly great dinner is as much about the setting as the cuisine, Meadowlark Ranch offers an unmatched canvas for intimate dinner parties:

- **Chef-curated menus** developed in partnership with Boulder County's top culinary talent
- **Elegant table settings** with fine linens, candlelight, and custom floral arrangements
- **Indoor and outdoor dining options** — from a candlelit barn dinner to an alfresco feast under the stars
- **Wine and cocktail pairings** selected to complement each course
- **Capacity for intimate groups of 10 to seated dinners for 100**

### Garden Parties

When the Colorado weather cooperates — and with 300 days of sunshine annually, it often does — our grounds become one of the most beautiful garden party settings on the Front Range:

- **Manicured lawns and garden spaces** with mountain views
- **Tented or open-air configurations** depending on the season and your preference
- **Passed hors d'oeuvres and refreshment stations** positioned throughout the grounds
- **Lawn games and activities** for guests of all ages
- **A relaxed, sophisticated atmosphere** that encourages mingling and conversation

### Fundraisers & Galas

For nonprofit organizations and charitable causes, Meadowlark Ranch provides a venue that elevates the mission and inspires generosity:

- **Dramatic setting** that differentiates your fundraiser from every hotel ballroom gala
- **Custom event design** that weaves your organization's story into every visual element
- **Auction and presentation spaces** equipped with professional AV and staging
- **VIP experiences** including private ranch tours and Percheron meet-and-greets
- **Catered receptions** designed to create an atmosphere of celebration and generosity

## Flexible Venue Options

Every private event at Meadowlark Ranch benefits from the full range of our venue options:

- **Indoor spaces** — Climate-controlled, elegantly appointed, and configurable to your needs
- **Outdoor spaces** — Ceremony lawns, garden areas, mountain-view terraces, and open meadows
- **Transitional spaces** — Covered patios and verandas that blend indoor comfort with outdoor beauty
- **Capacity** — From intimate gatherings of 10 to celebrations of up to 200 guests

## Personalized Service

What distinguishes a private event at Meadowlark Ranch is the depth of personal attention:

- **A dedicated event coordinator** who learns your preferences and anticipates your needs
- **Custom menu development** that reflects your tastes, dietary considerations, and the spirit of the occasion
- **Decor and design consultation** to ensure every visual element aligns with your vision
- **Day-of management** that allows you to be fully present as a host, not a logistics manager
- **Post-event coordination** including vendor settlements and thank-you facilitation

## The Ranch Experience

Every private event includes the intangible but unmistakable quality that defines Meadowlark Ranch: the feeling of being somewhere truly special. Your guests will notice it in the scent of sage on the evening breeze, in the silhouette of horses against the sunset, in the way the mountains catch the last light of day. These are the details that cannot be designed — only discovered, in a place that was made for gathering.
