## Champion Heritage. Sponsor Excellence.

The CCP Percherons program at Meadowlark Ranch represents one of the premier draft horse competition operations in the western United States. Maintaining a string of elite Percherons, training a six-horse hitch to competition standards, and traveling the Western States Classic circuit requires extraordinary commitment — and extraordinary support.

Our sponsorship program offers individuals and businesses a unique opportunity to align their brand with heritage, excellence, and the timeless appeal of the American draft horse tradition. When you sponsor CCP Percherons, you are not simply underwriting an equestrian program — you are investing in the preservation of a breed, the development of future horsemen and women, and a tradition that has shaped the identity of the American West.

## Why Sponsor CCP Percherons?

**Unmatched visibility.** Draft horse competitions draw passionate, affluent audiences across the western United States. From the National Western Stock Show in Denver to events in Arizona, Grand Junction, and Loveland, CCP Percherons puts your brand in front of engaged spectators who value quality, tradition, and craftsmanship.

**Meaningful alignment.** Heritage breed preservation resonates with audiences who care about stewardship, sustainability, and honoring the past while building the future. A CCP Percherons sponsorship signals your commitment to values that endure.

**Exclusive experiences.** Sponsors gain access to behind-the-scenes ranch visits, private hitch demonstrations, VIP seating at competitions, and unique hospitality opportunities that create lasting impressions for clients, employees, and partners.

**Community impact.** Your sponsorship supports not only the competition program but the broader Meadowlark Ranch mission, including equine-assisted healing and environmental stewardship.

## A Partnership Built on Shared Values

At Meadowlark Ranch, we view sponsorship not as a transaction but as a partnership. We work closely with each sponsor to ensure that the relationship delivers genuine value — not just in brand exposure, but in the pride that comes from supporting something that truly matters.

The Percheron is a breed that has served humanity for centuries. Preserving that legacy and showcasing these extraordinary animals at the highest levels of competition is work worth supporting. We invite you to join us.
