## Where Every Horse Is Known by Name

At Meadowlark Ranch, horse boarding is not a commodity — it is a commitment. Every horse entrusted to our care becomes part of the ranch family, receiving the same level of attention, expertise, and compassion that we devote to our own CCP Percherons string.

With professional boarding services available at both of our Longmont, Colorado locations, we offer horse owners the peace of mind that comes from knowing their horse is in the hands of people who understand that this animal is not simply a pet or an investment, but a partner.

## Full-Care Boarding

Our boarding program is designed around a simple philosophy: provide the level of care you would want for your own horse. Every boarding client at Meadowlark Ranch receives:

### Daily Turnout & Exercise

- **Scheduled daily turnout** in spacious, well-maintained pastures appropriate to your horse's temperament and social preferences
- **Individual or small-group turnout options** based on your horse's compatibility and your preferences
- **Weather-appropriate turnout management** — our team makes intelligent decisions about turnout based on conditions, not on a rigid schedule
- **Monitored pasture time** with regular visual checks throughout the day

### Premium Feed Programs

Nutrition is the foundation of equine health, and we take it seriously:

- **Customized feeding programs** developed for each horse based on age, breed, workload, and any special dietary needs
- **Premium hay** — we source the highest quality grass and alfalfa hay available in Northern Colorado, tested for nutritional content
- **Grain and supplement programs** tailored to individual requirements and owner preferences
- **Fresh, clean water** available at all times in both stalls and pastures
- **Twice-daily feeding** with additional feedings available for horses with higher caloric needs

### Climate-Controlled Facilities

- **Well-ventilated barns** designed to maintain comfortable temperatures in Colorado's variable climate
- **Generously sized stalls** with premium bedding, cleaned daily
- **Rubber matting** for joint comfort and ease of maintenance
- **Secure, well-lit aisles** for safe handling during all hours
- **Fly management systems** to keep your horse comfortable during warmer months

### Veterinary Coordination

- **Established relationships** with leading equine veterinarians in the Longmont and Boulder County area
- **Coordination of routine care** including vaccinations, dental floats, and wellness exams
- **Emergency veterinary response** — our team knows what to do and who to call if your horse needs urgent attention
- **Medication administration** for horses on prescribed treatment plans
- **Detailed health records** maintained and available to owners at any time

### Farrier Scheduling

- **Regular farrier visits** coordinated on a schedule appropriate to your horse's needs
- **Relationships with experienced farriers** who understand the specialized requirements of different breeds and disciplines
- **Owner notification** of upcoming appointments and any findings of note

## Specialized Draft Breed Care

As the home of CCP Percherons, Meadowlark Ranch has deep expertise in the care of large draft breeds. We understand that draft horses are not simply bigger versions of light horses — they have distinct nutritional needs, hoof care requirements, and handling considerations that demand specialized knowledge.

Our boarding program for draft breeds includes:

- **Oversized stalls** designed to accommodate horses standing 16 to 19 hands and weighing up to 2,600 pounds
- **Draft-specific feed programs** calibrated for the higher caloric and nutritional demands of large breeds
- **Farrier coordination with draft-experienced professionals** who understand the unique hoof care needs of Percherons, Shires, Clydesdales, and Belgians
- **Handling by experienced staff** who are comfortable and confident working with horses of exceptional size and strength
- **Equipment rated for draft breeds** — cross-ties, grooming areas, and loading facilities that accommodate larger horses safely
