## The Pinnacle of Draft Horse Competition

The **Western States Classic** is the premier draft horse show series in the western United States — a circuit of elite competitions that tests the finest heavy horse hitches in the region across disciplines that range from the precision of halter classes to the breathtaking spectacle of the six- and eight-horse hitch.

**CCP Percherons**, the competition arm of Meadowlark Ranch, is a proud and ambitious participant in this storied series. Under the leadership of Dr. Kirk Mitchell and the expert training of Head Trainer Wilbur Helmuth, our string of elite black Percherons competes at every level of the circuit, carrying forward a tradition of draft horse excellence that is as old as the American West itself.

## Competition Disciplines

Draft horse shows are far more than a parade of pretty horses. Each discipline tests different aspects of horsemanship, training, conditioning, and the profound bond between handler and animal.

### Halter Classes

The foundation of all draft horse competition. In halter classes, individual horses are evaluated on **conformation** — the physical structure, proportion, and breed-standard characteristics that define an exceptional Percheron. Judges assess bone structure, muscling, balance, movement, and overall quality. A halter champion is the embodiment of the breed standard: powerful, proportionate, and unmistakably magnificent.

### Single Cart

A single Percheron is hitched to a show cart and driven through a series of maneuvers that demonstrate the horse's training, responsiveness, and carriage. The driver must demonstrate precise control — walk, trot, reverse, and stand — while the horse displays the calm confidence and elevated movement that distinguish a polished show horse from a merely capable one.

### Unicorn Hitch

Three horses working in concert: two at the wheel and one in the lead. The unicorn hitch demands exceptional training and communication between driver and team. The lead horse must respond to subtle rein cues while maintaining distance and alignment with the wheel pair. It is a discipline that rewards finesse, preparation, and the kind of trust that can only be built through thousands of hours of partnership.

### Farm Team

A pair of horses hitched to a wagon, judged on their working ability, manners, and presentation. The farm team class honors the draft horse's agricultural heritage — the daily work that built America's farms and fed its cities. CCP Percherons competes in farm team classes with the same intensity and preparation brought to the hitch ring.

### Six-Horse Hitch

The crown jewel of draft horse competition. Six matched Percherons, hitched three abreast in two rows, draw a show wagon through a series of prescribed movements with a precision that defies their collective weight of nearly 12,000 pounds. The **six-horse hitch** is where horsemanship reaches its apex — where the driver must control six individual animals as a single, fluid unit, executing turns, reverses, and halts with balletic grace.

The CCP Percherons six-horse hitch is the flagship of our competition program. It represents years of breeding, selection, training, and conditioning — and when it enters the ring, it is a sight that brings audiences to their feet.

### Eight-Horse Hitch

The ultimate expression of draft horse power and precision. Eight Percherons, hitched four abreast in two rows, represent the most demanding configuration in the show ring. Not all programs field an eight-horse hitch, and those that do are recognized as the sport's most committed and capable operations.

## 2026 Competition Schedule

CCP Percherons is proud to compete at the following events during the 2026 season:

### Loveland Thunder
**January 16-18, 2026** — Loveland, Colorado

The season opener on home turf. The Loveland Thunder is one of the most anticipated draft horse shows in Colorado, drawing competitors from across the western states for a weekend of intense competition and camaraderie. As a Colorado-based program, CCP Percherons brings a home-field energy to this event that is palpable in the arena.

### Buckeye Draft Horse Show
**March 20-22, 2026** — Buckeye, Arizona

The circuit moves to the desert Southwest for one of Arizona's premier draft horse events. The Buckeye show attracts top-tier competitors and offers a stage for CCP Percherons to test our string against the region's best in a venue known for its knowledgeable and passionate audiences.

### Scottsdale Draft Horse Classic
**March 26-28, 2026** — Scottsdale, Arizona

Just one week after Buckeye, the circuit continues in Scottsdale — one of the most prestigious venues in western draft horse competition. The Scottsdale Classic brings together the finest hitches in the West, and CCP Percherons relishes the opportunity to compete back-to-back weekends at this level.

### Grand Junction Draft Horse Show
**May 15-17, 2026** — Grand Junction, Colorado

The spring season culminates in Grand Junction, on Colorado's Western Slope. This show offers a spectacular setting — the high desert landscape of the Grand Valley — and a fitting stage for the season's final competitions. CCP Percherons returns to Colorado soil for this event with the experience of the full circuit behind us.

## National Western Stock Show

In addition to the Western States Classic circuit, CCP Percherons is a proud participant at the **National Western Stock Show** in Denver — one of the most iconic livestock and equestrian events in the United States. The National Western draws over 700,000 visitors annually and represents the pinnacle of visibility for draft horse programs in the Rocky Mountain region.

Competing at the National Western is both an honor and a responsibility. It is the stage where the best in the West come to prove themselves, and CCP Percherons approaches it with the preparation and respect it deserves.

## The Team Behind the Hitch

The success of CCP Percherons in competition is a direct reflection of the people who prepare our horses day in and day out:

- **Dr. Kirk Mitchell** provides the vision, resources, and strategic direction that make a world-class competition program possible
- **Wilbur Helmuth** brings generational Amish horsemanship to every training session, conditioning program, and show-ring appearance
- **Makenna Helmuth** contributes tireless energy, a growing mastery of the craft, and the perspective of the next generation of draft horse excellence

Together, this team ensures that every CCP Percheron that enters the ring is prepared to represent the program, the breed, and the legacy of the American draft horse at the highest possible level.
