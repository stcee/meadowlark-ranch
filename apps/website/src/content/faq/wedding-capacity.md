Meadowlark Ranch can accommodate weddings for **up to 200 guests** across our indoor and outdoor venue spaces. Our outdoor ceremony areas include a sweeping mountain-view meadow framed by the Flatirons and Continental Divide, an intimate garden alcove, and a romantic creekside setting along the St. Vrain corridor. For receptions, our climate-controlled indoor spaces offer flexible floor plans that work beautifully for both intimate gatherings of 50 and grand celebrations at full capacity. We also offer a **bridal suite and groom's quarters** for day-of preparation, on-site parking, and our signature **horse-drawn carriage service** for a truly unforgettable arrival. Our dedicated event coordinator will work with you to configure the perfect layout and flow for your specific guest count and vision.
