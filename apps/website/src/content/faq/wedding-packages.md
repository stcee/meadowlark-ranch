Our wedding packages are **fully customizable** to match your vision, guest count, and budget. Every package includes full venue access for ceremony, cocktail hour, and reception; a **dedicated event coordinator** from first consultation through final farewell; ceremony and reception setup and breakdown with tables, chairs, and linens; access to our **bridal suite and groom's quarters**; and on-site parking coordination. Our signature **horse-drawn carriage service**, drawn by our magnificent CCP Percherons, is available as an included feature or an add-on, depending on the package. We also coordinate catering with Boulder County's finest culinary professionals, manage vendor relationships for floral design, photography, entertainment, and rentals, and offer custom decor consultation. Rehearsal dinner hosting is available the evening prior. We recommend scheduling a **venue tour** to experience the property firsthand, after which our events team will prepare a tailored proposal that reflects your specific needs.
