Meadowlark Ranch hosts a wide range of events in our stunning Boulder County setting. We specialize in **weddings** with horse-drawn carriage arrivals and mountain views for up to 200 guests, **corporate retreats** and **team-building experiences** featuring equine-informed leadership development, and **private celebrations** including anniversaries, milestone birthdays, family reunions, and celebrations of life. We also provide **carriage services** for parades, funerals, holiday events, and scenic rides. Every event is supported by our dedicated planning team and can be fully customized to your vision. Whether you are looking for an intimate dinner party for 20 or a grand celebration for 200, our indoor and outdoor venues offer the flexibility to create something truly extraordinary.
