Yes, Meadowlark Ranch welcomes horses of **all breeds** for boarding at our Longmont facilities. While we have particular expertise in **draft breeds** — including Percherons, Shires, Clydesdales, and Belgians — our full-care boarding program is designed to accommodate horses of every size and discipline. Each horse receives a **customized care plan** tailored to their breed, age, workload, and any special dietary or health needs. Our facilities include both standard and oversized stalls, and our experienced staff is comfortable and confident handling horses ranging from light riding breeds to the largest drafts. We maintain low horse-to-staff ratios to ensure every horse receives the individual attention it deserves. As the home of the CCP Percherons competition string, we bring a level of expertise to draft breed care that few boarding facilities can match. Contact us to discuss your horse's specific needs and current availability.
