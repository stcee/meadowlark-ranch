Meadowlark Ranch provides professional horse transport services throughout **Colorado** and four neighboring states: **Wyoming**, **Nebraska**, **Kansas**, and **New Mexico**. Within Colorado, we offer statewide coverage from the Front Range to the Western Slope, including mountain passes and rural destinations. Our transport fleet features climate-controlled trailers with experienced handlers who are trained in equine behavior and stress management during transit. We are particularly well-equipped for **draft breed transport**, with trailers rated for the size and weight of Percherons, Shires, and other large breeds. For longer hauls, we offer planned **overnight layover stops** at trusted equine facilities along the route, with stabling, feed, water, and turnout provided. For destinations beyond our primary five-state service area, please contact us directly — we are often able to accommodate extended transport requests with advance planning. Every transport includes comprehensive insurance coverage and real-time communication throughout the journey.
