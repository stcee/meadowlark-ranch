Absolutely. Many of our guests have never been around horses before, and we welcome them with open arms. Our **equine-assisted healing programs** and **team-building experiences** are entirely ground-based — no riding is involved — and are designed to be accessible to people of all experience levels and physical abilities. Our trained facilitators create a safe, supportive environment where newcomers can interact with our gentle Percheron horses at their own pace. For event guests, our horses are a beautiful part of the ranch landscape that can be admired from a comfortable distance, and our **horse-drawn carriage services** allow guests to enjoy the horses without any direct handling. Whether you are a lifelong equestrian or have never touched a horse, Meadowlark Ranch offers an experience tailored to your comfort level.
