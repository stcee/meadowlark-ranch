Absolutely. Meadowlark Ranch offers comprehensive **corporate event services** including retreats, offsites, strategic planning sessions, product launches, and client appreciation events. Our unique **equine-informed team-building programs** use ground-based interactions with our Percheron horses to develop leadership skills, improve communication, and build trust within teams. These sessions are facilitated by certified practitioners and require no prior horse experience. We accommodate groups of **10 to 100 participants** with half-day, full-day, and multi-day program options. Our facilities include dedicated meeting spaces with AV equipment, breakout areas both indoor and outdoor, full catering coordination, and the stunning backdrop of the Flatiron Mountains. Many organizations find that removing their team from the office environment and placing them in our extraordinary ranch setting produces breakthroughs that simply do not happen in a conference room.
